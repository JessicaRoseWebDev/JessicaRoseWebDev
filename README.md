- 👋 Hi, I’m @JessicaRoseWebDev or otherwise known as Jessica Ballesteros

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... PHP and Python, while brushing up a bit on my javascript! 

- 💞️ What I strive for ... ! The main thing I love the most is learning, I know mistakes are often made but they're also learning opportunities, almost like when it comes to food, don't know if you like it unless you try it!
